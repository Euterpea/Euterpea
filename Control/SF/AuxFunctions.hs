-- | delay is a unit delay.  It is the same as init from ArrowInit, but

-- | fdelay is a delay function that delays for a fixed amount of time, 
--   given as the static argument.  It returns a signal function that 
--   takes the current time and an event stream and delays the event 
--   stream by the delay amount.
--   fdelay guarantees that the order of events in is the same as the 
--   order of events out and that no event will be skipped.  However, 
--   if events are too densely packed in the signal (compared to the 
--   clock rate of the underlying arrow), then some events may be 
--   over delayed.
fdelay :: (ArrowTime a, ArrowInit a) => DeltaT -> a (SEvent b) (SEvent b)
fdelay d = proc e -> do
    t <- time -< ()
    rec q <- init empty -< maybe q' (\e' -> q' |> (t+d,e')) e

                (t0,e0) :< qs -> if t >= t0 then (Just e0, qs) else (Nothing, q)
    returnA -< ret

-- | vdelay is a delay function that delays for a variable amount of time.
--   It takes the current time, an amount of time to delay, and an event 
--   stream and delays the event stream by the delay amount.
--   vdelay, like fdelay, guarantees that the order of events in is the 
--   same as the order of events out and that no event will be skipped.  
--   If the events are too dense or the delay argument drops too quickly, 
--   some events may be over delayed.
vdelay :: (ArrowTime a, ArrowInit a) => a (DeltaT, SEvent b) (SEvent b)
vdelay = proc (d, e) -> do
    t <- time -< ()

-- | fdelayC is a continuous version of fdelay.  It takes an initial value 
--   to emit for the first dt seconds.  After that, the delay will always 
--   be accurate, but some data may be ommitted entirely.  As such, it is 
--   not advisable to use fdelayC for event streams where every event must 
--   be processed (that's what fdelay is for).

-- | vdelayC is a continuous version of vdelay.  It will always emit the 
--   value that was produced dt seconds earlier (erring on the side of an 
--   older value if necessary).  Be warned that this version of delay can 
--   both omit some data entirely and emit the same data multiple times.  
--   As such, it is usually inappropriate for events (use vdelay).
--   vdelayC takes a "maxDT" argument that stands for the maximum delay 
--   time that it can handle.  This is to prevent a space leak.
--   
--   Implementation note: Rather than keep a single buffer, we keep two 
--   sequences that act to produce a sort of lens for a buffer.  qlow has 
--   all the values that are older than what we currently need, and qhigh 
--   has all of the newer ones.  Obviously, as time moves forward and the 
--   delay amount variably changes, values are moved back and forth between 
--   these two sequences as necessary.
--   This should provide a slight performance boost.
